# ECSE 415: Intro to Computer Vision - Final Project
This repository contains our classifier and localization implementations for the **ECSE 415** final project. The goal of this project was to implement an SVM classifier and a localization method. Deep-learning based methods for both localization and classification were also accepted.

## Classifier
- SVM Classifer
- CNN Classifier

## Localization
Custom-trained version of [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) using [darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/).

## Authors
- Tristan Toupin
- Matthew Lesko
- Alexander Harris
- Abbas Yadollahi
- Filip Bernevec
